This Repository contains my work for homework 6 for UBC STAT 547 2018

The rmd file for homework 6 can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT547_hw06_JasmineLib.Rmd)  
the md file for homework 6 can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT547_hw06_JasmineLib.md)  

Note that due to the use of stringr, some of the output requires html. 
for this reason, I have also attached an HTML file, which can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-JasmineLib/master/STAT547_hw06_JasmineLib.html), though it is in a raw format.   
Perhaps an easier way to view the output is through [this PDF file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw06-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT547_hw06_JasmineLib.pdf) generated from the HTML version.

**In this assignment, I tackled exercise options 1 and 2.**

In 1, I work through all the exercises from the Strings Chapter of the [R for Data Science Textbook](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html)

In 2, I create the following functions, with step-wise improvements:
- a function to fit a linear regression to gapminder data - this was taken from [a tutorial](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html)
- next, I make my own function to fit a quadratic regression on gapminder data
- I then optimize these functions, as well as make simple functions in order to visualize the regression fits.
- finally, I make functions that fit gapminder data, and, using this fit, return a value on predicted life expectancy for specified countries.
